# googletest-cmake
An example implementation of the samples from [googletest](https://github.com/google/googletest/tree/master/googletest) using cmake.

I wanted to integrate googletest into a C++ project I was working on and wasn't able to find an example of just how to integrate it into a simple cmake build.  The cmake files in this repository show how to autmatically pull in googletest, write separate test cases and automatically run them as part of a build.
